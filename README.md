## Class Information

Congratulations on taking the first significant step towards your new career!

As you start your Software Engineering Immersive, we know you'll have many questions– this repo will be the home of most of the administrative info you will need as students for the next three months. This includes contact info for your leadership team, and course policies on homework, attendance, and plagiarism.

For more, you also have access to:

- The [course syllabus](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-phoenix/class-syllabus), containing the weekly and daily schedules, links to the Zoom recordings, and so forth; and
- The [course resources](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-phoenix/class-resources), containing templates, guides, syntax cheatsheets, and more.
